# What's in Standard?

As a new Magic: The Gathering player, I constantly got (and still get) mixed up
about which sets are in, are not in, are not yet in, and are not anymore in
Standard. The [official source](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)
is never inaccurate, but leaves a bit to be desired.
