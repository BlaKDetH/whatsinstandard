## API

Hey, welcome to this super awesome API. It's generated by me, a human. It has one endpoint! Here is an example request:

```bash
curl whatsinstandard.com/api/2/sets.json
```

This will return something like:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Return to Ravnica",
    "block": "Return to Ravnica",
    "code": "RTR",
    "symbol": "http://whatsinstandard.com/img/rtr.jpg",
    "enter_date": "2012-10-05T00:00:00.000Z",
    "exit_date": "2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z",
    "rough_exit_date": "late 2014"
  },
  ...
]
```

But you can just [visit it yourself][1] to see everything. You'll get some JSON containing an array of Magic sets. Each
set has some fields:

| field             | type                                                           | description                               |
|:----------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------- |
| `name`            | string                                                         | human-readable name of the set            |
| `block`           | string, or `null` if a core set                                | human-readable name of the set's block    |
| `code`            | string, matching regex `/[A-Z]{3}/`                            | official three-character code of the set  |
| `symbol`          | string                                                         | URL to the official set image             |
| `enter_date`      | string                                                         | release date of the set                   |
| `exit_date`       | string, or `null` if not exactly known                         | date the set exits Standard, if known     |
| `rough_exit_date` | string, matching regex <code>/(early&#124;late) 20\d\d/</code> | rough time of year the set exits Standard |

The set array is guaranteed to be in order of release, from oldest set to newest.

### Versioning

I only mention the most recent version of the API above. All previous versions are deprecated gradually -- sets that
fall out of Standard are removed from them properly, but newly-released sets are never added. So, all non-current API
versions will eventually just return `[]`.
