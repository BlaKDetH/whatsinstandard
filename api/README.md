## API

Hey, welcome to this super awesome API. It's generated by me, a human. It has one endpoint! Here is an example request:

```bash
curl whatsinstandard.com/api/3/sets.json
```

This will return something like:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Theros",
    "block": "Theros",
    "code": "THS",
    "symbol": "http://whatsinstandard.com/img/ths.jpg",
    "enter_date": "2013-09-27T00:00:00.000Z",
    "exit_date": null,
    "rough_exit_date": "late 2015"
  },
  ...
]
```

But you can just [visit it yourself][1] to see everything. You'll get some JSON containing an array of Magic sets. Each
set has some fields:

| field             | type                                                                | description                               |
|:----------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------- |
| `name`            | string                                                              | human-readable name of the set            |
| `block`           | string, or `null` if a core set                                     | human-readable name of the set's block    |
| `code`            | string, matching regex `/[A-Z]{3}/`                                 | official three-character code of the set  |
| `symbol`          | string                                                              | URL to the official set image             |
| `enter_date`      | string                                                              | release date of the set                   |
| `exit_date`       | string, or `null` if not exactly known                              | date the set exits Standard, if known     |
| `rough_exit_date` | string, matching regex <code>/(early\/mid&#124;late) 20\d\d/</code> | rough time of year the set exits Standard |

The sets array is guaranteed to be in order of release (aka `enter_date`), from oldest set to newest.

### Versioning

I only mention the most recent version of the API above. All previous versions are deprecated gradually -- sets that
fall out of Standard are removed from them properly, but newly-released sets are never added. So, all non-current API
versions will eventually return `[]`.

#### Changelog

##### Version 3
Valid `rough_exit_date` regex has changed from `/(early|late) 20\d\d/` to `/(early\/mid|late) 20\d\d/` to account for
the new Standard rotation style. Old API versions will continue to match their respective regexes, but with potentially
less accuracy. See Wizards's [article on the change][2] for details.

##### Version 2
Upcoming unreleased sets are no longer included in the sets array.
